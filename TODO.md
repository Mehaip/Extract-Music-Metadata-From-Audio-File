Album implementation:
We will do the following:
Whether an album is in the database or not will be strictly the user's decision
When inserting the song, check if the album's song is in the database.
If it is, associate the songs album id to the album id.
If it isn't, consider the song a single. The song's album id can be either NULL or I can create a "single" album so that it can separate it from the others.
